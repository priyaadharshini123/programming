You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :

Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.
Input: s = "a"
Output: true
Explanation: A single-character string is always a palindrome.
Input: s = "acbca"
Output: true
Explanation: "acbca" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome


class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to check if a string is a palindrome.
    bool isPalindrome(string& s) {
        // code here
        int n=s.length();
        string result="";
        for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
            result+=s[i];
            
            
        }
        if(result==s){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
    }
};

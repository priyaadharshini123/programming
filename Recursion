Recursion is a function which call itself until a specific condition is met.

in the recursion to prevent infinte time execution base condition is important.

Ex:
Given a non-negative integer n, your task is to find the nth Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1. The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1

class Solution {
  public:
    int nthFibonacci(int n) {
        // code here
        if(n==0){
            return 0;
            
        }
        else if(n==1){
            return 1;
        }
        return nthFibonacci(n-1)+nthFibonacci(n-2);
    }
};

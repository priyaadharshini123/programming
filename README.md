Increment and Decrement operator types:
Prefix and postfix :
Postfix Operator means: consider an example int a=10;
int b=a++; the output will be like a=11;  b=10; what it actually does means first assign the value to b then only a gets incremented this is why b gets 10 and  a=11.

Prefix Operator means: consider an example int a=10; 
int b=++a; the output will be like a=11;  b=11;  what it actully does means first  increment the value of a and then stores it in the b variable that why we get the value of a=11 and b=11;

for decrement also it works in the same fashion instead of plus the value get minus(i.e 10 means after decremnt 9).

This is the major difference of prefix and postfix operators.

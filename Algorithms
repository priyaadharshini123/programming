Algorithms are set  f instruction we write to execute  to achieve our task.
It has several predefined methods which simplifies our work.
1. Max function
cout<<max(8,9);
2.Min function
cout<<min(5,4);
3. sort function
sort(arr,arr+n);
//This will sort the array.
4. reverse(arr,arr+n)
//This will reverse the array elements.
5.*lower_bound(arr,arr+n,4)
This will return the address of first occurence of the element if that element not exist then it will return the before  lowest element  address.
6.*upper_bound(arr,arr+n,5)
This will return the address of last occurence of the element if that element not exist then it will return the next highest element address.
7.cout<<count(arr,arr+n,6)
This will return the count of element in the array.

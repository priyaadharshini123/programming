Deque is exatly same as vecot with only difference that it allow to add and delete elements at front which is not possible in vector 

//To initialize
 deque<int> de;
de.push_front(2);
de.push_front(4);
de.pop_back();
for(auto i:de){
cout<<i<<" ";
}
//It will print
2
Every other thing remains same as vecor.

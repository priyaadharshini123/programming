There are Infinite People Standing in a row, indexed from 1.
A person having index 'i' has strength of (i*i).
You have Strength 'P'. You need to tell what is the maximum number of People You can Kill With your Strength P.
You can only Kill a person with strength 'X' if P >= 'X'  and after killing him, Your Strength decreases by 'X'. 
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 14
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strengths of people is 1, 4, 9, 16, .... 
and so on. WE can kill the first 3 person , 
after which our Power becomes 0 and we cant 
kill anyone else. So answer is 3
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 2



long long int killinSpree(long long int n) {
        // Code Here
        long long l=1,j=n,ans=0;
        j=(sqrt(n));
        while(l<=j){
            
            long long mid=l+((j-l)/2);
            long long sum=((mid*((mid+1)*((2*(mid))+1)))/6);
            if(sum>n){
                j=mid-1;
            }
            else {
                ans=mid;
                l=mid+1;
            }
            
        }
        return ans;

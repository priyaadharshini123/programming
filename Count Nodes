Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

Output: 5
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 5, as there 
are 5 nodes present in it.
Input: LinkedList : 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
 
Output: 7
Explanation: Length of the linked list is 7, as there 
are 7 nodes present in it.
Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data <= 103


  class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    int getCount(struct Node* head) {
        // Code here
        int count=0;
        Node *temp=head;
        while(temp!=NULL){
            count++;
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        return count;
        
    }
};
